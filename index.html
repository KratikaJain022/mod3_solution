     <div class="siz" >Chicken</div>
  Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple cultural boundaries.
  With its mild taste and uniform texture, chicken presents an 
  intriguingly blank canvas for the flavor palette of almost any 
  cuisine A generation of Britons is coming of age in the belief that chicken
  tikka masala is the national dish, and the same thing is happening in China with
  Kentucky Fried Chicken. Long after the time when most families had a few hens running 
  around the yard that could be grabbed and turned into dinner, chicken remains a nostalgic, 
  evocative dish for most Americans.When author Jack Canfield was looking for a metaphor 
  for psychological comfort, he didn’t call it “Clam Chowder for the Soul.”

 Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. 
 The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality,
 velvety, fine-grained lean,bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth,
 and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous,the less desirable mature 
 beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved in one common
 aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C)
 encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.

    <div class="siz" >Sushi</div>
 Sushi is perhaps the most famous Japanese food in the world. Sushi is defined as dish 
 that is made with vinegared sushi rice. Although you can make sushi without using  fish 
 many kinds of seafood are used in sushi dishes.Since Japan is surrounded by ocean, 
 seafood has always been widely consumed as well as rice. Originally, 
 sushi was fermented fish with rice preserved in salt,
 and this was a staple dish in Japan for a thousand years until the Edo Period 
 when contemporary sushi was developed. The word "sushi" means "it's sour,"
 which reflects back to sushi's origins of being preserved in salt. Contemporary sushi
 was developed to be a type of fast food and remains so to this day.
